* npm init with entry point as server.js

* npm install express mongoose passport passport-jwt jsonwebtoken body-parser bcryptjs validator

* npm install -D nodemon

* we can do nodemon server.js or node server.js but it's better to add a npm script to do this.
In package.json, we add scripts - start and server
To run start - npm start
To run server - npm run server

* run : mongod --dbpath /home/dabasajay/Desktop/movie-buzz/mongoData
run : mongo
and get the address. Ex 127.0.0.1:27017
run robo3t and connect

* FOR FRONTEND REACT APP:
	npm start : start dev server
	npm run build : bundles app into static files for production
	npm test : start test runner

* npm i concurrently
	-> To be able to run both servers in 1 command
	-> Changes in scripts in package.json:
	    "client-install": "npm install --prefix client",
	    "start": "node server.js",
	    "server": "nodemon server.js",
	    "client": "npm start --prefix client",
	    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""

* npm i react-router-dom in client NOT server
